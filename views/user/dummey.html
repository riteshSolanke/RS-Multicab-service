   <h1> KEDARNATH TOUR PACKAGES</h1>

   <p>Kedarnath Temple Darshan 2022: Due to the snowy conditions, this Temple is mostly closed in winter. Every year, it opens between April and November (Akshaya Tritiya and Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). Located in the Himalayas, near the Chorabari Glacier, the Mandakini River's source, Kedarnath is one of the most magnificent Char Dham temples. Gaurikund, the nearest roadhead to Kedarnath, is around 14 kilometres away at 11,755 feet above sea level. A flash flood in 2013 and rocks falling from cliffs wreaked havoc on the village surrounding the temple. As valuable as the stone hump inside the shrine is the boulder that tumbled down from the hill and stopped short of the temple, protecting it from flooding and avalanches. Ensure that your Kedarnath Tour Package includes a long visit to the Kedarnath temple. Kedarnath Packages from Mauli Cabs are available for you to explore and book. Kedarnath Location</p>

At a distance of 223 kilometers from Rishikesh, Kedarnath lies on a vacant stretch of land along the Mandakini River.

Kedarnath Mountain, at 22,769 feet above sea level, skirts the Kedarnath Temple from behind, whereas Kedar Dome stands at 22,411 feet. Kedarnath's weather and the temple's closing Due to heavy snowfall, the Kedarnath Temple is closed during the winter.
